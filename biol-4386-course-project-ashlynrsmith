# Introduction 
Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a prominent topic in the research community. From gene linkage, genetic inheritance, to management, autism is a complex developmental disability with many unanswered questions. When autism is cooccurring in parallel with exceptional cognitive ability or twice exceptionality, those inquires grow larger. In this study, researchers aimed to determine the correlation between cognitive ability in ASD individuals and risk for suicidal thoughts. They predicted the greater cognitive ability in someone with ASD (IQ > 120) tranlsates to a higher risk for suicidal ideation. [^4] 

In previous studies, it has been proven that autism is associated with higher rates of suicide than those without ASD. [^1] The higher rates of suicide are most likley due to the increase in depressive symptoms that those with ASD experience. [^2] In addition, a study completed by the same group (Michaelson Lab) found that children with a high IQ (> 120) and ASD have greater feelings of inadequacy and internalizing problems compared to others with ASD and a below average IQ. [^5] This praticular study utilizes these established observations to prove that a twice exceptional individials with ASD are predisposed to have greater risk for suicidal idealization.

Fig. 2. ASD and IQ interact to increase suicidal thoughts. (SPARK & ABCD). A. Suicidal ideation in children from SPARK and ABCD, grouped by ASD status and whether their IQ proxy scores are in the exceptional range (top decile). B. Cumulative proportion of suicidal thoughts and their relation to Z-scaled cognitive ability scores for: ASD, NASD, and the expected rate based on permutations of the complete data set. C. Predictions of suicidal thoughts from a generalized linear model trained on the SPARK and ABCD data.

This figure I plan to reproduce summarizes the data observed in all of the sample cohorts in the study. Figure A shows the self reporting range of suicidal thoughts versus individuals without an ASD diagnosis (NASD), individuals with an ASD diagnosis (IQ<120), and a twice exceptional ASD individual (IQ>120). Figure B demonstrates the increased risk for suicidal thoughts in those with an ASD diagnosis. 14% of the sample of ASD individuals reported self-harm thoughts while only 2% of non-ASD individuals (NASD) reported self-harm thoughts. Figure C exhibits a higher score on the DSM depression scale for those with ASD than those without ASD (NASD). The data for the samples in this figure originate from SPARK and ABCD ASD cohorts. [^4]

This figure shows further evidence that those with an ASD diagnosis are more depressed and have rates of reported self-harm (graphs C and D). Graph A and B summarize these findings from graphs C and D but in addition with the results they recieved from the twice exceptional sample. In combining the results of the tables in this figure, they give resonable evidence to answer the proposed scientific question that those with twice-exceptionality have a higher risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

**Data Aquisition**

**SPARK**
This sample provides data from 1,982 individuals who were between the ages of 8-15 and whose Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) indicated suicidal thoughts. In addition the CBCL scores were combined with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) test. Any participant below the threshold of the 95th percentile was recorded. The score results were compared in graph C with SPARK particpants with ASD and ABCD participants without ASD (NASD). Graphs B and D in figure 1 use the CBCL survery to present the amount of participants with ASD reporting self harm and suicidal thoughts (SPARK participants) compared to those individuals reporting the same thoughts/self-harm without ASD (ABCD cohort). [^6]

**ABCD**
The ABCD cohort provides data for 11,878 children to represent a larger population of developing children outside of the ASD cohorts. The participants were subjected to the same CBCL survey and DSM and compared to the SPARK cohort in graphs B,C and D. [^3]

**Clinical**

The clincal sample was made up of 1,054 students/indviduals with an ASD diagnosis and an exceptional cognitive ability (IQ>120), NASD individuals and ASD individuals (IQ<120). This sample originates from a lab that specializes in the assesment of of gifted and twice-exceptional students. The data was compiled using Full Scale IQs from the Wechsler family of IQ tests. The data was presented in graph A in figure 1 to compare the differences in percentges of reporting self-harm among the 3 groups. [^5]

**Steps in Reproducing Figure 1**
*figure will be reproduced using R and Rstudio using script from author*
Loading Data: 
1. Load data into RStudio for clincial sample
2. Read in CBCL data from SPARK and ABCD samples into R
3. Read in indicator of who does not/does have an ASD diagnosis from SPARK and ABCD data set into R

Processing Data and Making Graphs: 
1. Filter SPARK, ABCD and clinical data and subset to 2e children with autism 
2. Filter clin====ical sample data into gifted control, ASD, ASD 2e. Filter groups by "reported suicidal thoughts" and "none reported"
3. Count up how many kids had suicidal thoughts in each diagnostic group and IQ group
4. Process CBL scores for SPARK and ABCD samples for graph C. Filter SPARK and ABCD data by NASD and ASD and "reported suicidal thoughts" and "none reported"
5. Will skip bootstrapping due to complexity for error bars as advised by my PI
6. Resample control groups, ASD 2e, and ASD average IQ
7. Count up how many people with autism thought about self-harm
8. Calculate the percentages of suicidal thoughts in each group from the tables made in the last step
9. Plot graphs A-D
10. Merge plots into 1 figure using patchwork package in R
11. Save plot
