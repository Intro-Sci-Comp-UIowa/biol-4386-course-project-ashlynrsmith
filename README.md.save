Fig. 2. ASD and IQ interact to increase suicidal thoughts. (SPARK & ABCD). A. Suicidal ideation in children from SPARK and ABCD, grouped by ASD status and whether their IQ proxy scores are in the exceptional range (top decile). B. Cumulative proportion of suicidal thoughts and their relation to Z-scaled cognitive ability scores for: ASD, NASD, and the expected rate based on permutations of the complete data set. C. Predictions of suicidal thoughts from a generalized linear model trained on the SPARK and ABCD data.

This figure I plan to reproduce summarizes the data observed in all of the sample cohorts in the study. Figure A shows the self reporting range of suicidal thoughts versus individuals without an ASD diagnosis (NASD), individuals with an ASD diagnosis (IQ<120), and a twice exceptional ASD individual (IQ>120). Figure B demonstrates the increased risk for suicidal thoughts in those with an ASD diagnosis. 14% of the sample of ASD individuals reported self-harm thoughts while only 2% of non-ASD individuals (NASD) reported self-harm thoughts. Figure C exhibits a higher

# Introduction 
Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a prominent topic in the research community. From gene linkage, genetic inheritance, to management, autism is a complex developmental disability with many unanswered questions. When autism is cooccurring in parallel with exceptional cognitive ability or twice exceptionality, those inquires grow larger. In this study, researchers aimed to determine the correlation between cognitive ability in ASD individuals and risk for suicidal thoughts. They predicted the greater cognitive ability in someone with ASD (IQ > 120) tranlsates to a higher risk for suicidal ideation. [^4] 

In previous studies, it has been proven that autism is associated with higher rates of suicide than those without ASD. [^1] The higher rates of suicide are most likley due to the increase in depressive symptoms that those with ASD experience. [^2] In addition, a study completed by the same group (Michaelson Lab) found that children with a high IQ (> 120) and ASDhave greater feelings of inadequacy and internalizing problems compared to others with ASD and a below average IQ. [^5] This praticular study utilizes these established observations to prove that a twice exceptional individials with ASD are predisposed to have greater risk for suicidal idealization.
