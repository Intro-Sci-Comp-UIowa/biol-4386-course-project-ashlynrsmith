Belin Blank Center
-(2009-2019), 1,254 children and adolescents ages six to 18 were evaluated at a university-based clinic
- Full Scale IQs as high as 158, a few of the clients evaluated at the clinic had very low IQs (e.g., 55). The average IQ for the
sample was 116.9 (SD of 14.5), the median was 117
 
 ABCD 
 -Release 3 data were used, CBCL data was available on 11,878 children. Z-scaled NIH toolbox full composite scores were the proxy used for IQ in this cohort, and these scores were available for 4,999 children
